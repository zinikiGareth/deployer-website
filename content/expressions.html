	Expression parsing in the deployer is significantly different to in most programming languages, and very different
	to the traumatic experience of trying to describe calculated values in Terraform or CloudFormation.  The intent
	has always been to try and make it possible to describe "values" in the most natural way possible.

<div class="para">
	It is up to individual verbs and contexts to decide where expressions start and finish, and whether only a 
	"single" token is to be used for an expression, or the rest of the line.  (A "single" token describes something
	like a number of a string, but also covers any whole expression beginning with a parenthesis, bracket or brace.)
</div>
<div class="para">
	The first thing that happens with expression parsing is that the expression is broken down into sub-expressions
	based on the presence of parentheses, brackets, braces, commas and colons: in short, explicit grouping, lists and maps
	are processed before other expression elements.

<div class="para">
	Within each sub-expression, parsing works from left to right.  Each symbol is identified as either a <i>function</i>,
	an <i>operator</i>, an <i>identifier</i>, a <i>constant</i> or a <i>sub-expression</i>.  Functions and operators are
	essentially the same.  Each of them is characterized as prefix, postfix or infix.  Each of them has a precedence
	level, and the parsing algorithm compares the precedence appropriately.  This is complicated, so it is most easily described
	by example.
