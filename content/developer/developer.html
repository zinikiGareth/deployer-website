    Ziniki Deployer is open-source, modular software.

    In the current climate, it would be almost impossible for any company to consider and provide code
    for all possible environments and use cases for a cloud deployer.  As noted elsewhere, even the cloud
    providers only do so through automatic generation, leaving the users to navigate the complexities of
    their environments.
</div>
<div class="para">
    By making Ziniki Deployer modular and extensible, and by endeavouring to provide both a reasonable user
    model and a simple internal model, we hope that most of our users - whom we expect to be software
    professionals or working in organizations with software professionals - will be able to add any features
    and modules that they feel are missing.  They can then release these back to the community.

    On the agile principles that "something is better than nothing" and "you can always start small" in order
    to get something working, it is possible to get minimal coins up in 20 minutes or so.  Adding more complex
    functionality such as properties and merging takes longer, but even so it is not a significant engineering
    effort.
</div>
<div class="note">
    It is our intent to provide a detailed guide to the internal models and processes, and to provide worked
    examples of the process of adding more coins, composites and commands in due course.  However, the internals
    are still in the process of being cleaned up and refactored at this time, so for now, adding new functionality
    is a more advanced study than it should be.  Please contact <a href='mailto:info@ziniki.org'>info@ziniki.org</a>
    if you want to extend Ziniki Deployer at this time.
