	After all the input files have been parsed, all the identifiers and symbols referenced in the files are
	resolved in a step known as resolution.
</div>
<div class="para">
	Most of the identifiers will refer to elements that are defined in code, for example
	<span class="code">+</span> refers to the addition operator, or <span class='code'>hours</span>
	refers to the built-in function to turn a number into a duration in hours.

<div class="para">
	It is also possible to define names in files.  Functions defined in modules may do this for
	any definitions they offer; by default, the only way to do this is to introduce variables using
	the verb interpreter.
</div>
<div class="para">
	Either way, the definitions are stored in an internal dictionary which understands the
	concept of block-based scope.  After parsing is
	complete, all the statements in the file are recursively traversed and all identifiers
	are examined and associated with the appropriate definition.  If no definition can be found,
	an error is generated.
