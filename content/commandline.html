			Note that <span class="italic">all</span> of the files in all of the specified directories will
			always be read and parsed whenever the deployer is run.  The intention here is to ensure that there is
			a limit to the amount of "drift" that can take place.  But only those targets which are explicity named
			on the command line will actually be executed.  One consequence of this is that unexpected errors may
			occur from files that you were not expecting to be read.
