            Most deployment tools (for example, Terraform or CloudFormation) seem to be written as an afterthought,
            with the most important criterion being how easy it is to build them, and to cover as much infrastructure as possible
            with the smallest amount of code possible.
            Little or no thoughts seem to be given to how easy it is to build, debug, validate and understand the configurations they are used to create. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Obviously, scripts or programs that are hard to understand are expensive to maintain and are more likely to contain bugs that are hard to spot.
            Identifying subtle security issues is guaranteed to be hard if you have to decipher a custom policy nested inside a JSON document.
            And yet, this is what platform engineers are expected to do when deploying expansive products. 
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Ziniki Deployer is different.  It is designed, from the ground up, to be a programming language that helps you to build modular,
            task-based scripts that are easy to understand and reason about.  Currently, it lacks support for a broad range of platforms and functions,
            but it is build in a _modular_ fashion that makes it possible to support those in a consistent way as they are needed.
            More importantly, it makes the features it does support easy to use.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Ziniki Deployer has six major attributes that make it different to other deployment tools out there:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li class="para">It has a focus on <b>clarity</b>: scripts should clearly communicate what they do, and not get lost in the minutiae of how they do it;
                scripts should be written in a language that is natural for the task at hand, not some general-purpose markup language.
            </li>
            <li class="para">It is <b>target based</b>: in their desire to pretend that it is possible to describe everything you want to do declaratively, most
                deployment tools lose sight of the fact that some operations require messy reality to be involved: servers may need restarting in order
                to notice a configuration change, for example.  Ziniki Deployer assumes that *you* know what processes you will want in place and allows
                you to create targets that affect just part of your infrastructure: starting and stopping instances or services in accordance with your
                needs.
            </li>
            <li class="para">It is <b>task oriented</b>: Ziniki Deployer assumes that you have in mind "something that you want to do" and will just want to issue
                a command to do that.  It does not require you to cobble together a number of operations in some broader script: all the operations should
                be able to be placed inside a Ziniki Deployer script.
            </li>
            <li class="para">It operates <b>idempotently></b>: CloudFormation attempts to pretend that it makes changes to infrastructure "atomically" and, if something
                goes wrong, starts to roll back the changes that it has made.  While this is a virtuous goal, the fact that AWS architecture is not, in fact,
                atomic means that you often get stuck in a state where some of the changes have been applied and some rolled back.  Ziniki Deployer does its
                best to ensure that the world is how it thinks it is before it starts operating (it gets its information about the state of the world directly
                from the source objects, not an internal "stack"), but if it does fail for any reason, it leaves the job "half done" and will then pick up
                where it left off after the (necessary) human intervention has resolved the problem.
            </li>
            <li class="para">It is <b>modular</b>: how modular?  So modular that with no modules installed, Ziniki Deployer is not, in fact, a task-based deployment tool,
                but simply a parser.  Everything from the idea of <span class='code'>target</span>s to its understanding of AWS primitives comes from one or more modules.
                Although this means that natively it has no understanding of your environment, it also means that it is just as capable of supporting Azure
                as it is of supporting AWS.  It also means that if you don't like what we have provided, you can easily add your own.
            </li>
            <li class="para">It expects you to use <b>composition</b>: there are idempotent primitives for many cloud infrastructure elements.  You could
                define all your configurations using these basic building blocks, but as humans, 
                <span class='italic'>we</span> don't think that way.  A cloudfront distribution requires
                five objects to be built and linked together just so: the <span class='code'>cloudfront.distribution.fromS3</span> composite does that for you.  Likewise,
                the <span class='code'>lambda</span> and <span class='code'>api.gateway.v2</span> composites require you to provide all the necessary parameters and build and link
                all the primitives together.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A Worked Example</h2>

deployment/deployer.dply
        <div class="para">
            Let's look at how those work through the lens of a simple example, the script that deploys this website (yes, we eat our own dog food, here).
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            The first thing to note about deployer scripts is that they are designed to be "semi-literate" in the tradition of Miranda, Haskell and
            FLAS.  We expect you to write more lines of description <it>about</it> your script than you do actual commands.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Anything that starts in column zero is assumed to be commentary and ignored by the script (although hopefully not
            by developers).  Blank lines (including lines with some white space) are also ignored.  Use them freely.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            For all <i>code</i> lines (i.e. all other lines), indentation is significant.  You may use
            any combination of leading spaces and tabs that appeals to you, but there is <i>no</i> conversion
            between the two and you must be consistent.  Hopefully, if you are inconsistent, you will
            receive a very clear error about what you have done wrong, but always bear in mind that there
            is no 100% reliable way of converting between tabs and spaces, so we simply don't try.
        </div>
        <div>
            Each level of indentation constitutes a sub-element of the parent (less indented) element.  It is up to each
            element as it is created to define what sub-elements it will allow.
        </div>
%segment
The deployer
        <div class="para">
            A <span class="code">target</span> wraps up a sequence of operations or
            assertions in a sequence.  This is one of a very few "top level" elements, i.e.
            elements that can appear at the minimum level of indentation in the file.
            It contains <i>action</i>s, that is, each element appearing one level indented from
            a target must be a deployment action.
        </div>
%segment
All of the content
        <div class="para">
            One of the key attributes of deployer scripts is that they are <i>idempotent</i>.  Much of the
            infrastructure is built up using the concept of <i>coin</i>s, which are elements
            of infrastructure which can be created and destroyed by using <span class="code">ensure</span>.
            This says that if the item already exists, leave it as it is (or update it if the script indicates
            changes); if the item does not exist, create it.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            In deployer scripts, commands that generate values can store those values in <it>variable</it>s.
            They do this by appending <span class="code">=></span>&nbsp;<i>variable</i> to the end of the command
            line.  Not all commands generate a value; in that case, it is an error to attempt to assign it.
            Commands that do not have side-effects but do generate a value <i>require</i> that value to be assigned
            to a variable and failure to do so is an error.
        </div>

Find the content
        <div class="para">
            Environment variables are a good way of handling externalities in scripts.  They can
            be easily set on the command line; they can be configured inside tools; and the deployer allows
            them to be specified in files given to the deployment using the <span class="code">-e</span>
            argument.
        </div>

Inside that

            <span class="code">files.dir</span> is a command that is used to navigate to a sub-directory of

%segment
Mirror the contents
        <div class="para">
            <span class="code">files.copy</span> copies all the files from the source to the destination.
            Both source and destination can be anything that knows how to copy (or <i>pour</i>) file contents
            from one place to another.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            As with everything in the deployer, the idea is that this command should be idempotent,
            and that means that the consequence of this operation is that, at the end, the contents of the
            destination should exactly match the contents of the source; and, the minimum number of
            transfers should be performed.
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            Sadly, this is not true at the moment.  It is just a copy operation.

In order to

            The next step in the script is to create a certificate.  In order to know how to create a certificate,
            the <span class="code">ensure</span> action needs to be given some <i>properties</i>.  The
            properties have a standard form which is to give the name of the property followed by
            a left arrow (<span class="code">&lt;-</span>) followed by an expression of the appropriate type.
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            In this example, only a few simple expressions are used.  There is complete documentation
            on the expression parser elsewhere, or at least there will be.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            When creating this certificate, we depend not only on the AWS module but the
            <span class='code'>dreamhost</span> module.  This must be specified on the command line
            and offers a DNS asserter using the Dreamhost API.  This enables you to automatically
            issue certificates on AWS even if your registrar is elsewhere.
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            There is currently a bug with Dreamhost specifically where the API does not permit the
            CNAME records generated by AWS for validation.  I have reported this, but have no current
            date on when it will be fixed.

Then we
        <div class="para">
            <span class="code">cloudfront.distribution</span> is an example of a composite pattern.
            In order to set up a cloudfront distribution, you need to create a network of interacting
            infrastructure objects, on top of things like the bucket and certificate that are truly
            external to the configuration.  It is possible to configure all those elements separately
            using <span class="code">ensure</span> and <i>coin</i>s (and there is an example of that),
            but it is hard work and requires you to remember all the objects you need to create, which
            order to create them in, and link them all together.  The composite used here makes everything
            much simpler.
        </div>
%segment
The CacheBehaviors
        <div class="para">
            Lists and maps can be complicated things to represent neatly in scripts; deployer
            offers three options to make it as simple as possible.  If you have a singleton
            list, you can just write the element with no special syntax.  If you have a short and concise
            list, or a simple map, you can write it all on one line within appropriate brackets or
            braces and with the elements separated by commas.  Or, if you have a more complex structure,
            you can assign the "empty" value to the property and then use an indented scope to
            insert the values.
        </div>
%segment
Finally
        <div class="para">
            We can create a CNAME record with the DNS registrar if it is not there (or update it
            if it is).  This is required to make sure that we have the custom domain name we want
            (in this case <span class="code">deployer.ziniki.org</span>) point to the <span class="code">domainName</span>

When

            Each file can have multiple targets in it; one or more targets can be specified on the

        <div class="para">
            In general, the "end point" of both paths should be the same, and it may often be desirable
            to just have the one path and always use the same command; on the other hand it may be
            clearer (and quicker) to have a custom path for updating content.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            It is obviously also important to consider permissions: fewer permissions may be

            It always operates by invalidating the current cloudfront cache, even if no changes have been
            made.
        </div>
        <div class="note">
            Two additional features are planned for deployer that would allow you to address this.
            Firstly, if and when the <span class="code">files.copy</span> operation is an update operation,
            it will be possible to tell if it has, in fact, updated any files.  Secondly, there will
            be a <span class="code">case</span> verb that allows conditional execution.  Combining
            these two will enable scripts to only invalidate the cache if files have changed.
