	Deployer has a very modular architecture.  So much so, that if you strip away all the modules,
	it is not even a deployer - it knows nothing about targets, and can do no work.  All of the
	functionality is contained in the modules.  The core of the system (the driver) knows how to
	parse files and nothing else.
</div>
<div class="para">
	The modularity works by using a set of extension points.  The main driver defines four of these
	(as shown below) and modules can define more as needed.  The core module defines five more, which
	define the core of how deployment works.  Other modules then provide implementations on offer for
	these extension points.
</div>
<div class="para">
	In each of the sections that follows, the module will describe the extensions it provides, grouped
	by the extension point names.  Here are the core extension points.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>main-args</span> - this extension point identifies the main entry point of the
	program, which will be responsible for processing arguments.  Only one definition of this extension
	point is permitted.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>top-level</span> - this extension point allows modules to provide verb handlers for
	specific verb names at the top level of the file.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>attacher</span> - this extension point allows items to be attached to the top level
	of the parse tree.  Most elements are attached to an "immediate parent", but top level elements do not
	have a parent; this code is used to handle that.
</div>
<div class="note">
	At the time of writing, this is not properly supported, since the only valid top level form is the
	<span class='code'>target</span>.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>function-defn</span> - this extension point allows modules to provide function definitions.
	The base driver code already includes basic definitions, listed below.
</div>
<h2>Builtin Function Definitions</h2>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>-&gt;</span> - method invocations are performed using the invoke operator <span class='code'>-&gt;</span>.
	This is defined at the driver level.  It is an infix operator with precedence 10 and left associative; it accepts
	one prior parameter (the object) and requires at least one post parameter (the method name).  Any additional
	post parameters are passed to the method invocation as arguments.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>+</span> - an infix operator with precedence 5 which is left associative.  It takes one prior
	and one post parameter and adds them together.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>-</span> - an infix operator with precedence 5 which is left associative.  It takes one prior
	and one post parameter and subtracts the second from the first.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>*</span> - an infix operator with precedence 6 which is left associative.  It takes one prior
	and one post parameter and multiplies them together.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>/</span> - an infix operator with precedence 6 which is left associative.  It takes one prior
	and one post parameter and divides the first by the second.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>sum</span> - a prefix function with precedence 1 which is right associative. It takes zero or
	more numeric arguments and produces	the sum of all of them.
</div>
<h2>Builtin Symbol Definitions</h2>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>true</span> - a constant defined to have the numeric value 1.
</div>
<div class="para">
	<span class='code'>false</span> - a constant defined to have the numeric value 0.
</div>
<div class="note">
	At the time of writing, these exist outside the normal extension point mechanism.  There probably should be an
	extension point for <span class='code'>constant-defn</span> or some such, but it is not entirely clear how it should
	work.
