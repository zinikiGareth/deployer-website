	Deployer has a very modular architecture.  So much so, that if you strip away all the modules,
	it is not even a deployer - it knows nothing about targets, and can do no work.  All of the
	functionality is contained in the modules.  The core of the system (the driver) knows how to
	parse files and nothing else.
</div>
<div class="para">
	The modularity works by using a set of extension points.  The main driver defines four of these
	(as shown below) and modules can define more as needed.  The core module defines five more, which
	define the core of how deployment works.  Other modules then provide implementations on offer for
	these extension points.
