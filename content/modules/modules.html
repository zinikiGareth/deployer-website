	Deployer has a very modular architecture.  So much so, that if you strip away all the modules,
	it is not even a deployer - it knows nothing about targets, and can do no work.  All of the
	functionality is contained in the modules.  The core of the system (the driver) knows how to
	parse files and nothing else.
